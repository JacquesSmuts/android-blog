This details how I made this static github page.

<!--more-->

First, I installed [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on my local machine and created a site.
I chose the theme [Hugo-Nuo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-nuo/) because it looked nice and because the author has a github page with regular updates and decent documentation.

It was not crashing, so I deployed it to a Github static page using the official [Hugo Guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) for hosting on Github.

Then I wrote this blog post using the standard template by running hugo new post/how_i_made_this.png and writing the rest in the resulting .md file.

Next I'm configuring my site's theme but this MVP is working so I'm deploying and adding a section below later.
