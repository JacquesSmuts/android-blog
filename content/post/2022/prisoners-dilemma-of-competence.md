## Background

I recently gave a presentation. As usual, I was nervous beforehand, and riddled with anxiety afterwards. Did I mess up? Was I wrong?

People told me it was a good presentation and I believe them. But afterwards, Nick Rout told me that I seemed entirely calm, and coulnd't pick up that I was nervous at all.

This got me thinking a bit, about how we perceive our own and other developers' competence in developer spaces.
