My original site is at [JacquesSmuts.com](https://jacquessmuts.com)

<!--more-->

There isn't a lot there. Since it's WordPress, I'll probably take it down some time and move everything to this site.

If I'm feeling less lazy, I'll probably host this static page there, or just set jacquessmuts.com to redirect here.
